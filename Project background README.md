# WDF
creating a wdf project
// the basic idea of our project is to create a website where potential new learners can register for a spot in a newly constructed highschool.
// The New Beginnings Highschool, also has hostel and gymnasium facilities of which the hostel can also be applied for.
// the system also acts as a login platform for existing learners of the highschool, however no activities are taking place at the moment as systems are being set up.
// the website is set up that is during the year 2018
// the website provides details considering the school, subjects offered, hostel facilities and fees, and more information concerning less important details but still relevant enough to inform the readers.
// the website is more so targeted at the parents of the learners than the learners, but also ensure the learner that they are taken into great consideration 
// this is but a short summary of our website
